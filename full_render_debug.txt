══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY SERVICES LIBRARY ╞══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown during a platform message callback:
A KeyDownEvent is dispatched, but the state shows that the physical key is already pressed. If this
occurs in real application, please report this bug to Flutter. If this occurs in unit tests, please
ensure that simulated events follow Flutter's event model as documented in `HardwareKeyboard`. This
was the event: KeyDownEvent#0e9e5(physicalKey: PhysicalKeyboardKey#c222c(usbHidUsage: "0x0007001d",
debugName: "Key Z"), logicalKey: LogicalKeyboardKey#5989a(keyId: "0x0000007a", keyLabel: "Z",
debugName: "Key Z"), character: "z", timeStamp: 16:23:06.003000)
'package:flutter/src/services/hardware_keyboard.dart':
Failed assertion: line 516 pos 11: '!_pressedKeys.containsKey(event.physicalKey)'

Either the assertion indicates an error in the framework itself, or we should provide substantially
more information in this error message to help you determine and fix the underlying cause.
In either case, please report this assertion by filing a bug on GitHub:
  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new?template=02_bug.yml
